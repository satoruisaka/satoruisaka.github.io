## My Research Focus

My research topic is **machine autonomy and developmental autonomous behavior** (see [1] for an outline of my research). For the past decade, I've been exploring the principles and mechanisms that enable machines to acquire new skills autonomously without human intervention. See [2]-[6] for my peer-reviewed publications on this work.

Unlike artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics, which predominantly focus on understanding human cognition and replicating human capabilities, my research is dedicated to examining autonomy from the machine's own perspective. The goal is **not to mirror human cognition** but to uncover the fundamental systems and processes that govern autonomous machine behavior.

This topic has a significant societal impact but is underappreciated. After three decades of solving real-world problems in the automation industry, I've been concerned with the **fundamental issues in integrating autonomy into automation**, which are related but distinct concepts. Granting autonomy to machines is a choice by humans, yet its implications are far more profound than most realize.

To articulate and address the issues more comprehensively, I am constructing a fundamental, philosophical framework (see [7], [8] for example) as well as an empirical, epistemic framework that captures embodied and ephemeral experience in a non-human context.

## Github Repo

In addition to machine autonomy, I've been actively building my own research tools by using open weight large language models (OW-LLMs) on my local machines. The best part of OW-LLMs is that I can customize and extend them to suit my specific needs without being constrained by the limitations of proprietary models. Everything runs locally, ensuring data privacy and control without requiring an internet connection.

For example, I built [MRA - My Research Assistant](https://github.com/satoruisaka/my-research-assistant), a personal interactive research tool that allows me to retrieve, query, and analyze all my research papers, references, and remote web content. All sessions are saved in my local storage so that I can query and resume sessions from the past. I use MRA everyday.

Other tools I've built are shown below. All these tools leverage OW-LLMs to provide advanced functionalities while maintaining full control over the data and processes involved. I run these applications I built on a high-powered GPU and 30B+ scale models in my compute machine. I appreciate the value of localized on-premise systems designed for affordability, customizability, and security.

## Biography

Satoru Isaka received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in systems science from the University of California, San Diego, in 1984, 1986, and 1989, respectively. His original research focused on adaptive control systems and artificial intelligence. From 1990 to 1998, he was a research scientist at OMRON in factory and healthcare automation. From 1998 to 2004, he served as Chief Technology Officer and Chief Scientist in the fields of service automation, natural language processing, speech automation, and data analysis automation at venture startups in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2004, he founded Vision Del Mar, LLC. where he continues his research.
